# Networks Exploration

## To Run this
Create a `/data` directory at the root and fill it with `.mat` files. Then run any of the methods you are interested in and follow the example of `main.py` for method abstractions to make your life easier

```python
# From the root directory, using python 3.10+
python -m metric-scripts.modularity
```

## Included Analysis
1. Centrality Measurement
2. Distance Measurement (with graph traversals)
3. Friend of Friend Calculations
4. Modularity according to Node Attributes Calculations
